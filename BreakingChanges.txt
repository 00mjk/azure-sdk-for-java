 * Removed setCopyState property from CloudBlob - it was marked reserved for internal use but nonetheless was public
 * Modified the CloudBlobContainer exists, delete, uploadMetadata, downloadAttributes APIs to take AccessCondition in order to specify LeaseIDs for these operations
 * Added throws StorageException to listBlobs and listContainers
 * Added throws StorageException to executeQuery methods for tables
 * Added throws XMLStreamException to commitBlockList
 * Container and Blob ChangeLease now returns the new lease ID
 * Blob downloadRange now takes a Long for length instead of int
 * Blob downloadRange now downloads to a Stream(newly added). The previous downloadRange has been renamed to downloadRangeToByteArray. Added downloadToByteArray.
 * getAttributes in ContainerResponse was made protected (the class was marked RESERVED FOR INTERNAL USE, but this was still accessible)
 * StorageErrorConstants: INVALID_XML_NODE_VALUE, UNSUPPORTED_XML_NODE has been removed
 * In tables, StorageErrorConstants: INVALID_DOCUMENT calls have been replaced with StorageErrorConstants: INVALID_DOCUMENT
 * Removed id field (along with getId, setId) from TableResult
 * Removed sparse page blob feature
 * The packaging structure has changed to
	1. com.microsoft.windowsazure.storage – RetryPolicies, LocationMode, StorageException, Storage Credentials etc. Basically all public classes that are common across services.
	2. com.microsoft.windowsazure.storage.core – These classes are reserved for internal use and users never have to include this namespace in their projects. 
	3. com.microsoft.windowsazure.storage.blob
	4. com.microsoft.windowsazure.storage.queue
	5. com.microsoft.windowsazure.storage.table
 * RetryResult class has been replaced by the RetryInfo class. Custom retry policies should implement RetryPolicyFactory and extend RetryPolicy.
 * Moved LeaseAction enum from core package to blob package (internal use only)
 * CloudBlobContainer.createIfNotExist was renamed to CloudBlobContainer.createIfNotExists
 * CloudQueue.createIfNotExist was renamed to CloudQueue.createIfNotExists
 * CloudTable.createIfNotExist was renamed to CloudTable.createIfNotExists
 * CloudBlobClient.streamMinimumReadSizeInBytes has been removed.  This functionality is now CloudBlob.streamMinimumReadSizeInBytes (settable per-blob, not per-client.)
 * CloudBlobClient.pageBlobStreamWriteSizeInBytes and CloudBlobClient.writeBlockSizeInBytes have been removed.  This functionality is now CloudBlob.streamWriteSizeInBytes, settable per-blob, and now using only one variable.
 * copyFromBlob has been renamed to startCopyFromBlob. This API requests the service to start copying a blob's contents, properties, and metadata to a new blob and returns the copy ID associated with the copy operation.
 * CloudBlob.tryBreakLease() was removed, as this method didn't do anything useful.  (BreakLease is already idempotent.)
